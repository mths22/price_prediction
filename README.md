# üìå Price Prediction for E-Commerce

This project aims to leverage data science techniques to automate price prediction for e-commerce products, enhancing pricing accuracy and competitiveness.

---

## üìÑ Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Many e-commerce businesses struggle to find the best prices for their products. They spend significant time and money researching prices to stay competitive. Additionally, e-commerce platforms with high product turnover face challenges in pricing new items accurately and quickly.

Incorrect pricing can lead to missed sales if the product is priced too high or loss of profit if priced too low.

## üìä Model Comparison

### Best Model: Linear Regression with L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)

- **Performance Metric:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **13.84**
  - Interpretation: The model's price predictions are, on average, **$13.84 off**.

- **Challenges & Improvements:**
  - Initial Overfitting: Caused by dataset distribution and outliers.
  - **Solution:** Removed outliers and applied a log transformation to the target variable, resulting in significant improvement.

## üìå SHAP Values Analysis

### Insights from SHAP Values:

- SHAP values identified the **most important numerical features**:
  - `Shipping` and `item_condition_id` were the most influential.
- Understanding feature importance highlighted the need for polynomial features to relate numerical variables with tokens for better pattern recognition.

### Challenges with Polynomial Features:

- Polynomial features require significant memory and computational power.
- Due to these limitations, full implementation has not yet been achieved.
- Proper implementation could significantly improve model performance.
