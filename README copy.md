📌 Price Optimization Project
Applying data science to optimize pricing strategies.

📄 Executive Summary
Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle with setting optimal prices for their products. Pricing too high may reduce sales volume, while pricing too low may diminish profits. The goal of this project is to analyze historical pricing and sales data to identify an optimal pricing strategy that maximizes revenue and/or profit.

Data Science Opportunity
Leverage historical sales data to find patterns in price elasticity.
Use predictive modeling to estimate demand at different price points.
Implement optimization techniques to determine the best price for maximum profitability.
Key Takeaways
Price optimization can significantly increase revenue by aligning prices with demand elasticity.
A data-driven approach helps avoid guesswork and improves decision-making.
Implementing the right model ensures pricing strategies are adaptive to market trends.
🎬 Demo
A live demo and detailed visuals are available:

📊 Data Visualizations: Trends in sales, pricing elasticity, and revenue.
🏗 Interactive App (Optional): Deployed using Streamlit for testing different pricing scenarios.
🎥 Video Walkthrough (Optional): A short video explaining the project and key findings.
🧑‍💻 Methodology
This project follows a structured data science workflow:

Data Collection

Gather historical pricing, sales, and customer behavior data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify trends, outliers, and seasonality effects.
Feature Engineering

Create meaningful features like discount rates, competitor pricing influence, and time-based factors.
Modeling Approaches

Regression Models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict demand.
Optimization Techniques to recommend pricing.
Prototyping & Validation

Implement A/B testing simulations to validate pricing strategies.
Deployment

If applicable, integrate pricing recommendations into a decision-support tool.
